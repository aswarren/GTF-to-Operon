The purpose of this software is to take GTF files generated by cufflinks (and possibly an external GFF file) and merge them so that transcripts/operons predicted by RNA-Seq data (using Cufflinks in deNovo mode) are represented with nested annotations.

Requires:
BioPython
pip install bcbio-gff (eventually to be integrated into Biopython)
